Computer Graphics Project 5: Triangle Meshes

http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/cs3451_2014_spring/hw5/hw5.html

This project I was unable to complete. I may go back and attempt completion at a later date.

Objective

The topic of this project polyhedral mesh manipulation. For this project you will implement methods of creating and modifying polyhedral surfaces. For object creation, you will read a mesh description from a file. Your program should be able to display flat or smooth shaded meshes, with either white or random colors. Finally, your program will construct the triangulated dual mesh of the current object. All of the mesh objects that you create and modify will be made of only triangles.
